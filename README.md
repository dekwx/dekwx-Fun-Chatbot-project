# New-project
I really don't know what this will be yet, but it sure will be fun!

Hey guys!
My virtual name is dekwx, but you can also call me by my real name Kuba.
I love mathematics and physics as you may know, but i also love coding. 
I am still beginner in this field, but i hope i will get better at it.
So, if you have some tips or fun-facts feel free to express yourself.
I hope you have a nice rest of the day. ;)


Hey guys, i know this is not a diary, but i still want to write here some of my thoughts
so you will understand my journey :). So i have been thinking and then it got me! I should
make a simple offline therapist. I want to do it in python and make it open-source so you 
can customize it for yourself. My mental health is pretty good, but sometimes i have bad 
feeling or i want to talk about something/someone and then i don't. Then i thought and i 
figured you will feel more free to confess your feelings to simple but thoughtful bot, who 
doesn't judge you or offer immediate solutions. Something that just asks about how was your
day etc. I hope this will maybe brighten someones day until it gets better. :)

Sometimes projects are born from joy, and sometimes from pain.  
This one carries both. It’s a reminder that even broken hearts can create something gentle,  
something that listens, and maybe even something that heals.
Speak your heart while you have the chance, or you may carry regrets tomorrow. 

This project is made with love and curiosity. It’s free, open‑source, and meant to help, not to profit.
I want all of you to know that someone cares about you!  
And if it feels like no one does, remember that I care about each of you.  
So please, don’t do anything harmful — talk to someone you trust instead. 💙
