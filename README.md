# New-project
I really don't know what this will be yet, but it sure will be fun!

Hey guys!
My virtual name is dekwx, but you can also call me by my real nema Kuba.
I love mathematics and physics as you may know, but i also love coding. 
I am still begginer in this field, but i hope i will get better at it.
So, if you have some tips or fun-facts fell free to express yourself.
I hope you have a nice rest of the day. ;)
