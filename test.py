number = 0

# Continue looping as long as 'number' is less than 100
while number < 100:
    number = number + 1  # Add 1 to the current number
    # Optional: print the number at each step
print(number) 

# This line runs after the loop finishes (when number is 100)
print(f"The final number is: {number}")

# i want to add this somehow to my bot like if you ask it to count to 100. Right now i really don't know how to make it useful but it is a cool script ig ;)
